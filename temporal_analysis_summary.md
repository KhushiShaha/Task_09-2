# Temporal Crime Analysis (Dec 16–31 Work Period)

We analyzed the 2023 Syracuse crime data by hour of the day and day of the week.
- **Peak crime hours:** 6 PM to 10 PM
- **Lowest activity:** Early morning (2 AM to 5 AM)
- **Day-wise trend:** Fridays and Saturdays show higher incidents, especially during evening hours.

These findings support the idea of deploying proactive patrols during high-crime windows.
